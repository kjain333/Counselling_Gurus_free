  News("One has to study very hard for IIT? I can’t do it!","<p>To achieve anything big in life one has to put the best efforts. And when we are talking about one of the toughest exams it is surely need of time. But merely working hard is not the key. There has to be proper planning, time management, managing the course and topics properly. You also need to ensure you are tracking and analyzing your performance repeatedly by mock examinations and tests. Every student, whether it be you, your friend, people who cracked JEE in past or anyone else, have the same 24 hours in a day and it all comes to how efficiently you managed and utilized your time. You will never find time for anything. If you want time you must make it.","","assets/images/m-blog-1.png"),
  News("I joined the best coaching institute. Why would i fail?","Many people develop this misbelieve that to crack JEE coaching is a must! They believe that joining a good coaching institute will make you more compatible to crack JEE and will act as a substitute to the hard work. This is absolutely wrong!To an extent, coaching helps you in channelizing your energy and efforts in right direction, by means of experienced faculties and presenting study material, questions, content and guidelines in simplified manner. But it does not mean if you are not joining a coaching your schedule will be a mess, you will never understand the concepts or you will not be able to crack JEE! Until and unless you don’t do vast variety of questions, develop understanding for the concepts and their applications under various scenarios, you won’t be able to gain the confidence that yes you can crack JEE. Most of the students are mislead by the fancy misleading advertisements in newspapers, pamphlets, Television or any other source bragging about the success and number of selections from their institute.  JEE can be cracked without coaching as well! Remember, and mark these words, at the end of the day, there is no magic in coaching institutes which can get you selected in JEE. The magic lies in you, you are the magician and the strong will and dedicated efforts will get you there. Coaching can help you in achieving the same.","","assets/images/m-blog-2.jpg"),
  News("Questions asked in JEE are very lengthy and complex!","A lot of students have this misbelieve that the questions asked in JEE are very long and run across the page. Gone are those days when JEE used to be subjective and completely solving 2 questions out of 5 was considered good. Questions in JEE now are focused on testing your conceptual knowledge, analytical skills and through understanding of topic along with numerical abilities. You don’t believe me? Go and check the previous year questions of IIT and note how many questions were there which asked for the mathematical labor. There will be set of questions not running down more than 3-4 steps but needed strong analytical and conceptual application. In recent years, the pattern of JEE is inspired by the NCERT format as well. You will find questions related to practical applications, laboratory experiments and related terminologies. The professors working on the JEE paper are wise and well aware that they are preparing it for a 12th pass-out kid and what has to be the difficulty level.  So what should be your focus be is to strengthen the conceptual knowledge & practice practice and practice. The price of success is hard work, dedication to job at hand, and determination that whether we win or lose we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at end.

  News("I have lot of time left still. I would study later!"," It’s never too early to start. There is no gain without pain. Remember, you know yourself better than anyone else. When you give yourself proper amount of time to study and grab to concepts it yields better results. It’s not like if you don’t prepare for minimum 2 years or start some foundation course from class 5th itself you can’t crack IIT entrance.  It’s more about understanding your capabilities and efforts needed for the goal and utilizing all the available time in best manner. Start today, not tomorrow. If anything, you should have started yesterday. The earlier you start, the more time you have to mess up.","","assets/images/m-blog-4.jpg"),
  News("Reading basics are for weak students. I will solve questions!","This is a common misconception that JEE aspirants have. It’s true that you need to practice on diverse variety of questions in order to understand all possible applications and questions. But often it is seen that students try to jump to questions after completing the theory and concepts in hurry.This is highly not advisable. Jumping to questions directly in hurry will lead to weak concepts and you will also not be having clarity while solving the questions.Before you move to the questions, ensure you have well understood the concepts, formulas and applications of the various topics. A wrong concept misleads the understanding. The pattern of JEE focuses on testing your conceptual ability. If you don’t have through concepts it will be difficult to solve the questions in exam when questions are mingled up from all the chapters. There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept.","","assets/images/m-blog-5.jpg"),
  News("I love physics but i hate mathematics? I will compunsate maths with physics!","This is a question a major section of JEE aspirants face! The subject you like and the subject you hate may change but there is always a subject you love studying or you perform better compared to the others. Now what should be done? Should you leave the tough subject (One you like or understand less) and focus on the interest subject? Would it give same results? The answer is NO. You might be able to compensate some part of the weak subject by scoring well in your strength subject but it won’t get the best rank possible for you. We all have habit of ignoring our weaknesses and focus on the strengths. It’s not just you, it’s all of us. We do it because it’s hard to work on weaknesses and mistakes. You have to take lot of pain to improve on the weaknesses. Give some extra time to the subject you face more difficulty in understanding. Consult and take proper guidance from the faculty at your school/coaching/tuitions. They will be able to guide you on the pattern and ways you should follow or books you should refer to.","","assets/images/m-blog-6.jpg"),
